# meanappwithcors
MEAN app created with UI and Server layer seperated and CORS enabled.

This has 2 folder. One for the UI and other for the server.
UI is developed using Angular 4
Server side is developed using Node JS, Express and MongoDB.

There is just one collection in MongoDB called books.
The collection can be populated using the UI alone.

CORS is enabled in this sample. 

This is a pretty simple usecase demonstrating CRUD operations in a MEAN stack application.

I am not using the autogeneration for _id field. It will be calculated automatically.
